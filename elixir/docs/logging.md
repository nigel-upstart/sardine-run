# Logging Best Practices

This guide defines logging conventions for Sardine Run so Codex can diagnose failures quickly.

## Goals

- Make logs searchable by issue and session.
- Capture enough execution context to identify root cause without reruns.
- Keep messages stable so dashboards/alerts are reliable.

## Required Context Fields

When logging session-related work, include both identifiers:

- `issue_id`: Tracker-internal session ID. For Traffic Control, this is the session directory name
  (typically equal to `issue_identifier`).
- `issue_identifier`: human session key (for example `MT-620`).

When logging Codex execution lifecycle events, include:

- `session_id`: combined Codex thread/turn identifier (`<thread_id>-<turn_id>`).

## Message Design

- Use explicit `key=value` pairs in message text for high-signal fields.
- Prefer deterministic wording for recurring lifecycle events.
- Include the action outcome (`completed`, `failed`, `retrying`) and the reason/error when available.
- Avoid logging large payloads unless required for debugging.

## Scope Guidance

- `AgentRunner`: log start/completion/failure with issue context, plus `session_id` when known.
- `Orchestrator`: log dispatch, retry, terminal/non-active transitions, and worker exits with issue context. Include `session_id` whenever running-entry data has it.
- `Codex.AppServer`: log session start/completion/error with issue context and `session_id`.
- `TrafficControl.Adapter` and `TrafficControl.SessionWriter`: log read/write outcomes with
  `issue_id` (the Traffic Control session directory name).

## Checklist For New Logs

- Is this event tied to a Traffic Control session? Include `issue_id` and `issue_identifier`.
- Is this event tied to a Codex session? Include `session_id`.
- Is the failure reason present and concise?
- Is the message format consistent with existing lifecycle logs?
